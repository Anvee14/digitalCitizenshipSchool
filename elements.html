            <li>
                <dh>Digital access:</dh>
                <dd>Although we live in a digital era, not everyone has access to technology. As teachers, we should be aware of this digital divide. Not all students can afford a computer, a smartphone, and Internet access. That's why educators need to provide suitable alternatives for each student's needs.</dd>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <dh>Digital commerce:</dh>
                <dd>Digital commerce highlights the necessity to tackle safety issues related to using money in the digital world. Technology is also used in the classroom to teach students about the various career paths that they could choose in the future. Understanding how e-commerce works is a must, both as consumers and as potential entrepreneurs.</dd>

            <br>
            <li>
                <dh>Digital communication:</dh>
                <dd>Online communication has become so common that students forget they are doing so in a virtual space, where miscommunication happens often. The Internet has given a voice to anyone who needs it. In turn, this requires empathy and appropriate reactions from its users.</dd>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <dh>Digital literacy:</dh>
                <dd>Digital literacy also includes the ability to differentiate between real and fake content, which can have a negative impact on the lives of your students. They need to learn which content is good for them and what they should avoid in order to lead a balanced life.</dd>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <dh>Digital etiquette:</dh>
                <dd>We should teach students to become "digitally fluent". Digital etiquette shapes their online behavior to respond positively to online content. In this way, their online attitude is reflected in the real world and vice versa.</dd>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <dh>Digital law:</dh>
                <dd>The online environment has room for both positive and negative interactions. Digital law deals with legal rights and restrictions governing technology usage. To prevent any kind of online crime, no matter how serious, students as digital citizens need to know the law and how it applies to them in particular.</dd>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <dh>Digital rights and responsibilities:</dh>
                <dd>The online world has its regulations and a user has rights and responsibilities. The Internet can also be used for harmful purposes and anyone needs protection against cyberbullying, for instance. Schools should approach this subject in classrooms, hold students accountable for their actions and also report any misconduct in the virtual environment.</dd>
