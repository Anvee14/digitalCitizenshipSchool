            <h3>Digital citizenship is the ability to navigate our digital environments in a way that's safe and responsible and to actively and respectfully engage in these spaces. Although we live and interact in the digital world in a similar way to the offline world, we're not always as mindful of our actions online.</h3>

            <h3>Digital media also provide unique opportunities for everyone to get involved, to speak out and to make change both online and offline. Our actions in our online world can have a real impact and we all have a role to play as active digital citizens.</h3>
